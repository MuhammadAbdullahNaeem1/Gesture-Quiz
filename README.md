# Gesture Quiz
Hand Gesture Math Game with Timer


This Python script utilizes the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to create an interactive math game that combines hand gesture recognition with arithmetic challenges. The game presents a series of math equations to the user, and the user must answer by showing the correct number of fingers using hand gestures. The game includes a countdown timer for each question, providing an additional challenge.

#Features:

Randomly generates arithmetic equations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Uses hand gestures to input answers, leveraging the MediaPipe library for hand tracking.
Implements a countdown timer for each question, adding a time-sensitive element to the game.
Provides feedback on the correctness of the user's answer and displays the overall score.
How to Run:


#How to Play:

Open your hands wide for detection.
A math equation will be presented.
You have 7 seconds to show the correct answer by closing your fingers.
Keep your hands at an optimal distance from the webcam for accurate detection.
Press 'q' to terminate the window at any time.
The game challenges your quick thinking and precise hand movements. Can you solve the equations in time? Give it a try with GestureMathRiddle!


#Note:

Ensure that the script is run on a machine with a webcam for hand gesture detection.
Feel free to customize and enhance the script for your needs or contribute to its development!
